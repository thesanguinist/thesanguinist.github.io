          <p>Throughout my 20's I worked in hospitality and retail and in my late 20's decided I wanted to do work that I enjoyed, will earn me more money and most importantly, I find fulfilling and am passionate about.</p>
          <p>It was at this point I decided to study Environmental Policy and Management at the University of Adelaide. At the time, I thought it was the perfect degree as I am interested in high level analysis as well as getting into the detailed understading of how things work. Gaining and understanding of climate change, environmental managemet helped me ease some of my climate anxieties. However, throughout my degree, I realised that, while I was passionate about climate change adadptation and mitigation and sustainability in general, I had other interests as well so I started exploring various electives not so closely related to my major such as physics, marketing, and business electives. Furthermore, for some time I attempted studying at 42 Adelaide as well as I am interested in developing technological solutions to various envrionmental problems. However, after completing some projects, realised I needed to prioritise my university studies.</p>
          <p>I am currently searching for work which can utilise the skills I learnt at university while while developing my business acumen. I am also continuing my software engineering learning journey through various online courses.</p>
